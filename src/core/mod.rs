//! The core components of the AI SDK, including traits, types, and the main generation function.
//!
//! This module provides the essential building blocks for interacting with language models.
//! It defines the `LanguageModel` trait, which all model providers must implement,
//! and includes the primary `generate_text` function for initiating text generation.
//!
//! Key types like `GenerateTextCallOptions` and `GenerateTextResponse` are also
//! re-exported for convenient access.
